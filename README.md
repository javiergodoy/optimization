# Optimization Project

This project is focused on optimization techniques and algorithms.

## FreshBox Logistics Scenario

The repository now includes a Python re-creation of the FreshBox Logistics
cost-optimization exercise that was originally designed for Excel. The
`freshbox_optimization.py` script:

* Builds the operational dataset for the six-month period.
* Calculates total monthly operating cost, cost per delivery, and exception
  flags for high fuel spend and low on-time performance.
* Identifies the month with the highest cost per delivery and the cost driver
  contributing the most to that result.
* Summarizes average spending by cost category and selects the category with
  the greatest optimization potential based on cost variability.
* Generates a cost trend chart saved to `outputs/freshbox_cost_trends.png`
  when `matplotlib` is available and prints a recommendation to reduce costs in
  the targeted category.

Run the analysis with:

```bash
python freshbox_optimization.py
```
